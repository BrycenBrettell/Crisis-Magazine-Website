	<h1>History</h1>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;At the outset, the Crisis magazine was designed to advance 
	the goals of the NAACP. Generally, this meant pursuing legal action to bring
	equality to African Americans. In 1910, the NAACP called upon W.E.B. Dubois,
	arguably the most well known African American leader of the time, to be the 
	editor of the magazine. As a cofounder of the NAACP, his goals were, of 
	course, closely aligned with those of the organization. In the first
	publication of the editorial, Dubois made his intentions clear: 
	<em>“The object of this publication is to set forth those facts and arguments
	which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested today
	toward colored people. It takes its name from the fact that the editors 
	believe that this is a critical time in the history of the advancement 
	of men. …Finally, its editorial page will stand for the rights of men, 
	irrespective of color or race, for the highest ideals of American democracy,
	and for reasonable but earnest and persistent attempts to gain these rights
	and realize these ideals."</em> 
	(The Crisis, November 1910, 10). Thus, the Crisis: A Record of the 
	Darker Races, was born.

	<h1>Impact</h1>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Despite humble beginnings as a 20 page magazine with fewer
	than 1,000 subscribers, the Crisis would eventually grow into a impactful
	force for change in the U.S., especially in Harlem. This ascent is due in 
	part to the ambitious, high-minded goals of the magazine, as well as the 
	variety of talented individuals called upon to contribute to each edition. 
	Jessie Fauset, for instance, was an African American author, essayist, and 
	poet who was instrumental in the growing literary movement of African 
	Americans. She served as literary editor of the Crisis for eight years
	during the Harlem Renaissance. As one can image, the pages of the Crisis
	were often brimming with powerful works by the likes of Jessie Fauset,
	W.E.B. Dubois, and other writers who came during the explosion of talent 
	during the Harlem Renaissance.
	</br></br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Dubois, hailing from Harvard with a doctorate degree, was an
	avid advocate for advancement through formal education. This was prevalent 
	in the Crisis, as he often devoted entire pages to advertisements for 
	universities. The magazine encouraged the development of black universities 
	and reported on their efforts to educate African American youth. This 
	emphasis on education was a method of growing the “Talented Tenth” of 
	intellectual African Americans who were expected to uplift the race, in 
	Dubois’ opinion.
