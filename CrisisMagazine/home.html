	<h1>The Crisis Magazine</h1>
	<p>
		&emsp;&emsp;With its first publication in November, 1910, The Crisis 
		Magazine preceded the start of the Harlem Renaissance. Crafted by the 
		hand of the highly influential figure W.E.B. Dubois, the Crisis Magazine
		was bound for success thanks to his celebrity status and literary 
		expertise. To no one's surprise, the Crisis was a highly politicized 
		paper. It often hosted opinions supporting ideas of racial uplift 
		through legal action and “The Talented Tenth”, a group of influential 
		African-Americans who would portray their race in the brightest light 
		possible. Various member of the Talented Tenth, like Jessie Fauset and 
		Langston Hughes, were featured on the Crisis, and W.E.B. Dubois himself
		wrote many pieces for the magazine. As such, the primary focus of the 
		paper was political.
		<br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;Even so, the Crisis had a major impact on art fields
		of the Harlem Renaissance. It was not uncommon to read poetry, prose, 
		short stories, and plays in the editorial. Additionally, Dubois utilized
		photography as a means of adding another dimension to the Crisis. On 
		occasion, political cartoons commenting on current events were also 
		present. In conjunction with the work of master authors and editors, the
		Crisis proved to be a powerful means to inform and influence its broad 
		audience of readers.
