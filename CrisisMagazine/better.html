	<h1>Featured Videos</h1>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The first video of this collection is my group's final 
	project Touchcast. In it, we discuss the early history and foundation of
	the Crisis, its impact on the Harlem Renaissance, and the relationship
	between it and the NAACP.

	<h2>What We Learned</h2>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;With the completion of this project, we've deepend our
	understanding of the Crisis magazine. It seems that one of the best ways to
	understand a time period is to see what people were talking about, which is 
	exactly what our research on the Crisis expanded upon. It was used as a
	primary mode of message spreading during the Harlem Renaissance, but not 
	just through text. Sure, we read articles, but there were stories, 
	photographs, art, and even advertisements embedded in the Crisis. Therefore,
	as a team, by focusing on this one aspect of the Harlem Renaissance, we 
	actually learned about many.</br>
